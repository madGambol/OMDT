;; 
;; RTI Next Generation RID (Run-Time Initialization Data) File
;; NTF 2.6 Draft 4 20090122
;; ===========================================================
;; This file contains configuration parameters that control the operation of the
;; RTI software.  All parameters have a default setting that is used in the
;; event that a parameter value is not specified in the RID file or a RID file
;; is not specified.
;;
;; File Location
;; =============
;; The RTI-NG software looks for the environment variable, RTI_RID_FILE, which
;; defines the name and location of the RID file to be used by the application.
;; The file location may be absolute or relative using the appropriate file
;; naming convention for the particular operating system.  The file name is not
;; required to have a special name or prefix, it only needs to be readable by
;; the application and provide the correct syntax.
;;
;; If the environment variable is not set, the RTI will attempt to open a file
;; named "RTI.rid" in the directory from which the application was launched.
;;
;; File Format
;; ===========
;; The format used for the RID file has only several rules relative to valid
;; parsing.  The first item is that any text to the right of the comment token,
;; (two semi-colons, ";;"), is ignored by the parser.  The next rule is that the
;; left and right parentheses are used for scoping and must always be used in
;; matching pairs.
;;
;; Within a pair of parentheses there can be the scope name or a parameter name
;; and value pair.  The scope name is used to organize parameters that are
;; conceptually related and ensure uniqueness in case a parameter name is used
;; multiple times within different scopes.  If a parameter name is not unique
;; only the last value will be used for the configuration control.  The
;; parameter name is case insensitive and the value is parsed as a character
;; string and subsequently interpreted according to the particular parameter
;; type (e.g., integer, floating point, string).
;;
;; Parameter Scoping
;; =================
;; Each RID parameter is identified by a scope name in which the scoping is
;; broken into three major categories according to the granularity of the
;; internal RTI components.  The RTI-NG instantiates components when an RTI
;; process is initially started (the first create or join), when a federation
;; comes into existence within the process (first create or join of a new
;; federation), and when a particular federate joins a federation.  These scope
;; names are defined below.
;;
;;  ProcessSection    - process level component parameters
;;  FederationSection - federation level component parameters
;;  FederateSection   - federate level component parameters
;;
;; It is possible that a RID file used by a particular application will need to
;; support multiple federations and federates within a single process using
;; different RID parameter values for each federation or federate.  This RID
;; structure can support this situation by creating a scope within the
;; federation or federate section with the scope name the same as the name of
;; the federation or name of the federate, respectively.
;;
;; As an example, assume that an application needs to support two different
;; federations named FederationA and FederationB.  The RID parameter for the
;; multicast base address for FederationA needs to be different from
;; FederationB.  An example RID is shown below where the BaseAddress used for
;; FederationB is "224.100.0.1" and for any other federations the value is
;; "224.2.0.1".
;;
;;  (FederationSection
;;     ...
;;     (BaseAddress 224.2.0.1)
;;     ...
;;     (FederationB
;;        ...
;;        (BaseAddress 224.100.0.1)       
;;        ...
;;     )
;;  )
;;
;; There are a few parameters that can be specified at a federate level.  For
;; these, an example is shown below:
;;
;;  (FederationSection
;;     ...
;;     (MinimumCacheSizeBeforePerformingPurge 32000)  ;; All federations except
;;                                                    ;; FederationB
;;     ...
;;     (FederationB
;;        ...
;;        (MinimumCacheSizeBeforePerformingPurge 32000) ;; All Federates except
;;                                                      ;; federateC 
;;        ...
;;        (FederateSection
;;           (FederateC
;;              ...
;;              (MinimumCacheSizeBeforePerformingPurge 32000) ;; for FederateC
;;                                                            ;; only
;;              ...
;;           )
;;        )
;;     )
;;  )
;;
;; Parameter Definition
;; ====================
;; Each parameter contained in the RID file provides a description of the effect
;; that the parameter value has on the operation of the RTI.  The valid
;; parameter values are defined and the default value is specified within this
;; file.  As previously mentioned, if the parameter and value is not specified
;; within the RID file the default value will be used by the RTI.

(RTI
 ;; The RTI scope serves as a namespace for the RID user parameters.  No
 ;; parameter entries should be made at this level.
 
 (ProcessSection
  ;; Entries in this section apply to the process level components.

  ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.RTIMode
  ;; DESCRIPTION: When set to "connectionless", the RTI will initialize into
  ;; a connectionless state.  This special state eliminates all connected 
  ;; components such as TCP.  As such, the rtiexec is not needed to run in
  ;; connectionless mode.  HOWEVER, many RTI services must be sacrificed in
  ;; order to achieve a connectionless state including reliable updates &
  ;; interactions, ownership management, save & restore, synchronization, 
  ;; MOM, and time management.  The use of any of the above features is
  ;; prohibited while in "connectionless" mode.  Therefore, special
  ;; consideration must be given to federations wishing to use this mode.
  ;; Connectionless may be useful for federations with unreliable networks.
  ;; Most users should use the default "standard" setting.
  ;; RANGE: An enumeration value {Standard, Connectionless}
  ;; DEFAULT VALUE: Standard.
  ;;
  (RTIMode Connectionless)

  (RtiExecutive
   ;; The RTI Executive is a logically centralized process that is used as a
   ;; network wide resource manager to handle such items as the uniqueness of
   ;; federation names.  It is logically centralized since redundant processes
   ;; can be used for fault tolerance (although this feature is currently not
   ;; supported).  The parameters associated with the RTI Executive control
   ;; how the process is found on the network.

   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.RtiExecutive.RtiExecutiveEndpoint
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The RTI Executive endpoint defines the network address and
   ;; port number used by the RTI Executive process (and hence the RTI Naming 
   ;; Service).  The network address can be a hostname or an IP address.  The 
   ;; endpoint is only necessary when the multicast discovery mechanism is not 
   ;; used and the endpoint must match the value provided when the RTI Executive 
   ;; process is started.
   ;; RANGE: A valid hostname or IP address followed by a colon and then the
   ;; port number.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: None, will use multicast discovery mechanism.
   ;;
   ;;;;   (RtiExecutiveEndpoint hostname:port)

   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.RtiExecutive.
   ;;            RtiExecutiveMulticastDiscoveryEndpoint
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The RTI Executive discovery parameter defines the multicast
   ;; address and port number used for the multicast discovery protocol to find
   ;; the RTI Naming Service which is located in the RTI Executive process
   ;; The naming service will then enable the application to locate distributed 
   ;; RTI components (e.g., RTI Executive).
   ;; RANGE: A valid multicast IP address (or hostname) followed by a colon and
   ;; then the port number.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: 224.9.9.2:22605
   ;;
   ;;;;   (RtiExecutiveMulticastDiscoveryEndpoint 224.9.9.2:22605)

   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.RtiExecutive.NumberOfAttemptsToFindRtiExecutive
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The NumberAttemptsToFindRtiExecutive parameter is used to
   ;; control how many attempts the application should use to locate the RTI
   ;; Naming Service using the multicast discovery mechanism.
   ;; RANGE: An integer value greater than zero.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: 10
   ;;
   ;;;;   (NumberOfAttemptsToFindRtiExecutive 10)

   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.RtiExecutive.TimeToWaitAfterEachAttemptInSeconds
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The TimeToWaitAfterEachAttemptInSeconds parameter is used to
   ;; control how long the application should wait between attempts to find the
   ;; RTI Executive using the multicast discovery mechanism.
   ;; RANGE: A floating point value greater than zero.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: 2.0
   ;;
   ;;;;   (TimeToWaitAfterEachAttemptInSeconds 2.0)
   );; End of ProcessSection.RtiExecutive

  (Networking
   ;; The Networking section is used to define the communication configuration
   ;; information associated with all of the RTI components within the
   ;; application using this RID file.

   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Networking.FederateEndpoint
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The Networking endpoint defines the network address and port
   ;; number used by the federate application process using this RID file.  The
   ;; network address can be a hostname or an IP address.  The federate endpoint
   ;; is used by other distributed RTI components to communicate with internal
   ;; modules within this application.  Typically the federate endpoint does not
   ;; need to be defined unless the computer has multiple network interfaces.
   ;; If an environmental variable named RTI_FEDERATE_ENDPOINT is found, its 
   ;; value will be used in favor of what is specified here.
   ;; RANGE: A valid hostname or IP address followed by a colon and then the
   ;; port number.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: The default network card and the port.
   ;;
   ;;;;   (FederateEndpoint hostname:port)

   (MulticastOptions
    ;; The networking multicast options define the parameters that control the
    ;; behavior of UDP communication within the RTI that is used for Best Effort
    ;; transport.

    ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Networking.MulticastOptions.PerformCrcChecking
    ;; DESCRIPTION: When PerformCrcChecking is set to yes, CRC checking is
    ;; performed on all messages sent/received via multicast.  Messages failing
    ;; the CRC check are discarded.  Note that CRC checking can be
    ;; computationally expensive and should only be turned on if you suspect
    ;; that your network hardware is not functioning properly.
    ;; RANGE: An enumeration value {Yes, No}
    ;; DEFAULT VALUE: No.
    ;;
    (PerformCrcChecking Yes)

    ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Networking.MulticastOptions.Interface
    ;; DESCRIPTION: The Interface is used to specify which ethernet
    ;; interface shall be used to send and receive multicast traffic. On
    ;; most systems the possible interfaces can be listed with the netstat
    ;; command).  If no interface is specified, the default is used.
    ;; NOTE: This parameter does not effect multicast name service discovery.
    ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
    ;; DEFAULT VALUE: None.
    ;;
    ;;;;   (Interface "eth0")

    (Fragmentation
     ;; The UDP communication protocol (used for Best Effort transport) does
     ;; not fragment and reassemble data.  For messages larger than the UDP
     ;; fragmentation size the RTI must fragment the message into smaller
     ;; packets on the send side and then reassemble the packets on the
     ;; receiver side.

     ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Networking.MulticastOptions.Fragmentation.FragmentSize
     ;; DESCRIPTION: The FragmentSize is used to define the maximum number of
     ;; bytes that can be used as the payload in a UDP packet.  Different 
     ;; networks may be capable of supporting different UDP Maximum Transfer
     ;; Unit (MTU) values.
     ;; RANGE: An integer greater than zero representing the number of bytes.
     ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
     ;; DEFAULT VALUE: 63000
     ;;
     ;;;;     (FragmentSize 63000)

     ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Networking.MulticastOptions.Fragmentation.ReassemblyTimerIntervalInSeconds
     ;; DESCRIPTION: TheReassmeblyTimerIntervalInSeconds parameter is used to control how long
     ;; control how long the receiver will wait to receive all of the fragments
     ;; that make up a single message.  Since UDP is not a reliable communication
     ;; protocol the fragments can be lost and the receiver needs to know how long
     ;; to wait before discarding incomplete fragments.  For performance reasons
     ;; the RTI does not create a timer for each fragment set, instead a common
     ;; timer is used and each incomplete fragment set is incremented and removed
     ;; after MaxTimeouts.
     ;; RANGE: A floating point value greater than zero.
     ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
     ;; DEFAULT VALUE: 1.0
     ;;
     ;;;;     (ReassemblyTimerIntervalInSeconds 1.0)

     ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Networking.MulticastOptions.Fragmentation.MaxTimeouts
     ;; DESCRIPTION: The MaxTimeouts parameter is used to control how long the
     ;; receiver will wait to receive all of the fragments that make up a
     ;; single message.  Since UDP is not a reliable communication protocol the
     ;; fragments can be lost and the receiver needs to know how long to wait
     ;; before discarding incomplete fragments.  For performance reasons the RTI
     ;; does not create a timer for each fragment set, instead a common timer is
     ;; used and each incomplete fragment set is incremented and removed after
     ;; MaxTimeouts.
     ;; RANGE: An integer value greater than zero.
     ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
     ;; DEFAULT VALUE: 3

  (ProcessModel
   ;; The process model controls the mechanism used by the RTI to obtain
   ;; processing cycles and support callbacks to the federate during the tick
   ;; call.

   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.ProcessModel.StrategyToUse
   ;; DESCRIPTION: There are currently two process model strategies that are
   ;; supported by the RTI; (1) polling process model and (2) asynchronous I/O
   ;; process model.  The polling process model uses a single thread of
   ;; execution shared between the RTI and the federate.  Only when the federate
   ;; calls tick is the RTI able to perform work.  This strategy can starve the
   ;; RTI if tick is not called appropriately.  The asynchronous I/O process
   ;; model uses an internal thread within the RTI to avoid starvation.  This
   ;; thread will periodically wake up and determine if it can perform any
   ;; internal RTI work.  In the asynchronous I/O strategy the federate only
   ;; needs to invoke tick when it is prepared to handle callbacks.
   ;; RANGE: An enumeration value {Polling, AsynchronousIO}.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: AsynchronousIO

   );; End of ProcessSection.ProcessModel

  (Scheduler
   ;; The Scheduler section contains parameters associated with the behavior of
   ;; the tick service.


   ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.Scheduler.SingleCallbackPerTick
   ;; DESCRIPTION: When using the tick service without the minimum and maximum
   ;; time arguments the RTI can be directed to return a single callback or
   ;; provide all available callbacks.  Using this service with a setting of No
   ;; indicates to the RTI that all available callbacks should be delivered to
   ;; the federate in a single tick() call.
   ;; RANGE: An enumeration value {Yes, No}.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: No.
   ;;
   ;;;;   (SingleCallbackPerTick     No)

   );; End of ProcessSection.Scheduler


  (InterceptSection
   ;; This section contains parameters which control the creation and
   ;; activation of pre-defined ambassador intercepts for the RTI Ambassador
   ;; and the Federate Ambassador.  Note that a given intercept will
   ;; intercept calls for both ambassadors.  Also, the order that the
   ;; intercepts are called will not necessarily match the order which they
   ;; appear in this section.  The intercepts may be controlled also 
   ;; using the rtiConsole.

   (AmbassadorIntercepts
    ;; This section lists the intercepts for all ambassadors in this process, regardless
    ;; of which federation or federate they are used with.  Note, only one intercept for
    ;; each type may be specified in this section.  A single intercept type cannot be 
    ;; specified as both active and inactive.
 
    (Active
     ;; This section provides the list of intercepts that should be created and activated
     ;; for the ambassador.  These intercepts will immediately begin intercepting all calls
     ;; through the ambassadors.

     ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.InterceptSection.AmbassadorIntercepts.Active.<InterceptType>
     ;; DESCRIPTION: The type of intercept to activate on the ambassadors.  Any number of these 
     ;;              parameters may be specified, but only one for each intercept type.  The
     ;;              intercept types must also be pre-defined.

    (Inactive
     ;; This section provides the list of intercepts that should be created, but not activated
     ;; for the ambassadors.  These intercepts will NOT intercept any calls
     ;; through the ambassadors until they are activated.

     ;; PARAMETER: ProcessSection.InterceptSection.AmbassadorIntercepts.Inactive.<InterceptType>

   ;; DESCRIPTION: The Federation Executive endpoint defines the network address
   ;; and port number used by the Federation Executive process.  The network
   ;; address can be a hostname or an IP address.  Typically, the endpoint only
   ;; needs to be defined when the Federation Executive needs to use the
   ;; non-default network interface, or when the Federation Executive (i.e.,    
   ;; fedex) is to run on a different host than the RTI Executive.
   ;; RANGE: A valid hostname or IP address followed by a colon and then the
   ;; port number.
   ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is not checked for consistency across the federation.
   ;; DEFAULT VALUE: Will use same default hostname on the host where the RTI
   ;; Executive is running, with a system generated port number.
   ;;

   ;; DESCRIPTION: This parameter provides the pathname to the directory used
   ;; when producing new saved files or processing existing saved files.
   ;; RANGE: A valid directory pathname.

   ;; PARAMETER: FederationSection.FederationExecutive.TimeoutForSerializationLockInSeconds
   ;; DESCRIPTION: Specifies how long to wait before timing out the serialization lock after
   ;; the last time the requester renewed it.  The lock is used for serializing join, resign,
   ;; destroy, save and restore across the federation.  A value of 0.0 or Off disables the 
   ;; timeout.  Use Off warily, as it can cause the federation to not allow any processes
   ;; to perform any of these actions if a process with the lock fails to release it.

  (FederationInterconnect
   ;; The FederationInterconnect section contains parameters associated with the
   ;; configuration of reliable transport configuration channels.

   ;; PARAMETER: FederationSection.FederationInterconnect.StrategyToUse
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The interconnection of RTI nodes for reliable traffic can use
   ;; either a CollocatedEventChannel or a CentralizedEventChannel strategy.  The
   ;; CollocatedEventChannel strategy allows each RTI node (i.e., each federate
   ;; application) to contain a "TCP exploder" that is connected to every other

     ;; DESCRIPTION: This parameter controls the number of bits to use

     ;; the federateHandle of the object instance's creator and a instance
     ;; counter.  By default, the fedreateHandle is 16-bits and the counter
     ;; is 16-bits.  This allows for each federate to CREATE a maximum of
     ;; 64K (2^16) objects and to DISCOVER a maximum of 4G (2^32) objects from

     ;; However, in some cases, 64K object creations is not enough.  
     ;; Furthermore, the ability to have 64K federates may be excessive in

     ;; for creating federate handles.  Smaller values limit the total number
     ;; of federates that may join a federation but at the same time increase

   ;; PARAMETER: FederationSection.DataDistribution.StrategyToUse
   ;; DESCRIPTION: The routing of federation data using the RTI Data
   ;; Distribution Management (DDM) services can be implemented using different
   ;; techniques.  Each technique will have different characteristics that may
   ;; effect the performance of DDM depending on the particular operating
   ;; conditions of the federation.  The initial data routing strategies offered
   ;; are:
   ;;   Simple - Uses two data channels, one for Best Effort and one for
   ;; Reliable transport.  This scheme provides no segmentation of data based on
   ;; DDM usage and is useful for testing purposes.
   ;;   StaticSpacePartitioned - Uses two channels per routing space, one for
   ;; Best Effort and one for Reliable transport.  This scheme segments data
   ;; according to the routing space that a particular class or attribute is
   ;; assigned to in the RID file.  This mechanism provides a simplification to
   ;; the grid partitioned scheme in which segmentation is only required based
   ;; on the routing space, not the particular update and subscription regions
   ;; within a space.
   ;;   StaticGridPartitioned - Uses two channels (Best Effort and Reliable) for
   ;; each hypercube formed by partitioning each dimension of a routing space in
   ;; a grid like fashion.  The number of partitions in each dimension is user
   ;; defined.  This scheme offers the federation control of how to statically

   ;; used only limit the number of bytes that are sent across the network.
   ;; Overspecifying this value can lead to poor network performance. 
   ;; Underspecifying the value will lead to errors being generated at
   ;; run-time during createRegion.  Note that only values crossing byte
   ;; boundaries are significant.  E.g. values 0x00-0xff perform identically,
   ;; values 0x100-0xffff perform identically but worse than the first example,

   ;; subscription regions intersect.  If ReceiverSideFiltering is disabled,
   ;; updates & interactions may be received by the federate even if pub/sub
   ;; regions do not intersect; only sender-side filtering is performed.  The
   ;; effect of this parameter depends upon the DDM strategy used, the regions
   ;; used, and the partitioning within the DDM strategy.  When disabled, this
   ;; parameter can significantly reduce the amount of network traffic and

       ;;            NumberOfSubspacePartitions.<Non-Negative Integer>
       ;; DESCRIPTION: You may specify the number of partitions to use for
       ;; the 2nd & 3rd dimensions for each of the NumberOfSubspacePartitions
       ;; partitions.  Partition IDs are numbers from 0 to 
       ;; NumberOfSubspacePartitions - 1.  Partition IDs outside of this
       ;; range are ignored.  A single entry per ID includes a user-defined
       ;; name for the partition and up to 2 subentries.  The subentries
       ;; must have a name of either dimension1 or dimension2 and can contain
       ;; a single value for each.  The value specifies the number of
       ;; partitions for the 2 remaining dimensions.
       ;; RANGE: An integer value greater than zero.
       ;; CONSISTENCY: This parameter is checked consistency across the
       ;;              federation.
       ;; DEFAULT_VALUE: <None>
       ;; Example: If NumberOfSubspacePartitions is 5 and default is 8 then
       ;;          the following entries:
       ;;(0 (part0 (dimension1 3) (dimension2 3)))
       ;;(2 (part2 (dimension1 1)))
       ;;(3 (Whatever (dimension2 2)))
       ;;(4 (part0))
       ;;(5 (part0 (dimension1 1) (dimension2 1)))
       ;;          would cause the following partitioning:
       ;; Appspace    Name        2D-MxN space
       ;;    0        part0         3x3
       ;;    1        <undefined>   8x8
       ;;    2        part2         1x8
       ;;    3        Whatever      8x2
       ;;    4        part0         8x8
       ;;
       ;; Note that the (5 (part0 (dimension1 1) (dimension2 1))) entry is
       ;; ignored in this case since NumberOfSubspacePartitions has
       ;; only 5 partitions.
       ;;
       ;; In addition to the appspace and dimensions, bundling parameters
       ;; may also be specified.
